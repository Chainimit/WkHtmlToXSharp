TODO
====

 - Find a way to make (real) concurrent conversions.
	- This depends on an internal limitation of wkhtmltopdf-qt. (only one qApplication)
 - Correctly marshal strings as UTF-8.
 - Unit tests!!
 - Add more properties to PdfGlobalSettings & PdfObjectSettings.
 - Support more than one PdfObjectSettings per conversion.
 - Create a common IHtmlToPdfConverter
 - Implement our own SynchronizationContext code to avoid using DelegateQueue.
	- It works great, but seems a bit to bloat for this use case.
	- See: http://www.idesign.net/idesign/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=5&tabid=11 (Custom Synchronization Context)
- Use an independent AppDomain inside MultiplexingConverter, just the same way we use a worker thread and proxy calls it it.
